# Kotlin Native Rust interop

This project is a Work in Progress

This is a sample projet to test interop between kotlin native and a rust library.

Main test target for the time being is iOS simulator

## Generate rust library

### Prerequisites

You will need `cbindgen` to generate c headers for FFI calls `cargo install cbindgen`

You will also need `cross` to be able to cross build your library `cargo install cross`

### Library building

Go to `rust/rust-lightning-bridge` and run the following to generate headers and library:

```
cbindgen --config cbindgen.toml --output bridge.h
cross build --target x86_64-apple-ios --release
```

## Build iOS app

Open iOS app in XCode then a run should do the trick, if you change the rust part, you will need to do a clean
on the Kotlin project (after having rebuilt the Rust project) to ensure changes are properly taken into account.


## Troubleshooting

In case of weird linker errors, don't hesitate to change Kotlin Multiplatform plugin version.

I noticed that 1.3.41 provides better error messages than 1.3.70 for instance
